        I don't just work with these technologies â€” I excel at applying
        them using industry best practices to deliver high-quality,
        production-ready solutions. From deep learning models to blockchain-integrated
        web platforms, I've consistently used my skills in MERN stack, machine learning,
        and secure systems to build impactful, real-world portfolio projects that reflect
        both technical depth and practical application.
